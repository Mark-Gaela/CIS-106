1. Which project will you be completing?

I will be working on building SAMBA file server

2. Why have you chosen this project?

I'm choosing this project because I personally want to get some experience with configuring/making a file server for my own personal use. This would help me with not being reliant on Google Drive or Dropbox.

3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?

Possible problems I may see myself encountering in this project is working in the linux environment because I have no prior experience before this class. Another problem I can see is configuring the  network settings so that I can access it from my own home network.

1. How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?

I plan on looking at how other people approached making a SAMBA file server. I can use many resources online such as video tutorials, articles, or forums to help me in this project.

1. How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?

As a medical informatics major, I can see this project helping me get some personal hands on experience with working with the properties of working with a network or at least understanding what each thing does. File and directory permissions is new to me so that can strengthen my studies in that.
