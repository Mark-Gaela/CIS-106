####1. Which project will you be completing?

I will be working on building a cloud server using NextCloud.

####2. Why have you chosen this project?

I'm choosing this project because I personally always wanted to make a media sever to access my own content anywhere. I can also reuse the hard drives in the future so the expenses aren't just for this class..

####3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?

Possible problems I may see myself encountering in this project is working in the linux environment because I have no prior experience before this class. Another problem I can see is configuring the NextCloud network settings such as DDNS to allow me to access it outside of my network.

####4. How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?

I plan on looking at how other people approached using NextCloud. Looking at other people's documentations and personal settings that fit their criteria that I can maybe adopt.

####5. How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?

As a medical informatics major, I can see this project helping me get some personal hands on experience with working with networking. Instilling networking terms into my head because my knowledge of networking fundamentals is weak because I took it the class a long time ago.
