When researching what is a SAMBA Server is, I learned that it is a protocol called Server Message Block or the SMB protocol. This server protocol helps bridge the network between the linux file server and Windows machines. In this project I'll be learning how to configure and set up a path for the SAMBA server and configure the sharing permissions such as read,write, and execute for users, groups, and others.
