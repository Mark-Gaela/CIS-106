When researching the NextCloud, I stumbled upon NextCloudPi which looks to be an instance of preinstalled software bundled together that is dedicated to configuring NextCloud in a single package. It has a more wizard based setup when configuring NextCloud. They have multiple variations to install NextCloudPi. With my project, I am going to try and pursue using NextCloudPi with VirtualBox. I choose to pick the VirtualBox route because snapshots will be a save point for me since I don't have too much experience Linux and being prone to making stupid mistakes. I will specifically use a virtual box of Ubuntu to install NextCloudPi onto it.

With the path I'm taking to create a NextCloud, I'll be learning how work with configuring my SSH and DNS. I will also need to work with my router's gateway. With NextCloud, I will need understand how Port Forwarding works.
