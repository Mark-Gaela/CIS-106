## Part 1
Watch these videos:
* [What is Open Source?](https://bit.ly/3bQwE3z)
* [Open Source vs. Closed Source Software](https://bit.ly/3irHu1b)
* [Open Source Basics | Intel Software](https://bit.ly/2LBF8RK)

Answer the following question:

1. What are the advantages of open source?
   * The advantages of open source software compared to proprietary software is that any programmer can contribute to the software instead of just a company or small team of people. Another advantage is that open-source software tend to have more power-user features because there is no need to restrict the environment of work. 

2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
   * The basic freedoms of open source is that:
     * You can run the program for any purpose
     * You can analyze the source code and change it how you wish
     * You and redistribute to others
     * You can redistribute your branch  on the source code to others which in turn can benefit the whole community.
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
   * People should use free/open-source alternatives to the proprietary versions because there may solutions to problems that can make things more efficient. Another reason is that your are less restricted to the controlled environment that proprietary software can put you in. Another big reason is that open-source software is often free compared to proprietary software having a price tag.
4. Watch the following video: [Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPPikY3uLIQ) Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. 
   * I partially agree with Richard Stallman's stance of proprietary software. The idea that proprietary software controls the user and enforces their idealogy of how you should work is a hinderance to technology. While proprietary software is bad for a community, I believe that it as it's pros too. Proprietary software can also push programmers to make open-source solutions where they can make an improvement. The changes is market-share can play a role and cause a movement in usage.
